# Calculator
Calculator is developed using Python

This application has following functionalities:
* The application solves a complex mathematical equations from basic maths containing fractions, mixed fractions, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus & exponentiation.  Ex. - (4.2 + 567 - 231 * 0.34 / 22) * (2.3 / .078847 ^ 2 ) % 23
* There should be proper parsing of expressions and must check for errors in the statement. Ex - Raise error on 4.5 * (0.67382 / * 34)
* Range for whole number must be precisely between -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647 & 7-digits precision for decimal numbers.
* The application must calculate all the sub-expressions simultaneously. Ex.- In expressions (0.23 * (-0.83462784 * 32437821 + 0.345384) - 0.0109) / 87 + 232), each sub expression must be calculated asynchronously to get final result.
* The interface of the application should be simple Command Line Interface (CLI) with proper display of all operations.
* Application should be able to read expressions from files.
* Application should able to store calculation history.
* The application should be available on LINUX as well as windows (NFR).

1. **Calculator is made using Python concepts only (no use of any python modules or libraries).**
2. **Calculator is made of GUI using Tkinter python module.**
